# Testing

## Pytest

[Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) is a testing framework for Python.
It is a mature full-featured Python testing tool.

## Doctest

Python supports [doctest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html),
which is very convenient for testing small code snippets within docstrings.
And, it's make the usage of the code more clear.

```python
def add(a, b):
    """
    >>> add(1, 2)
    3
    >>> add(2, 3)
    5
    """
    return a + b
```

!!! tip "Run doctest"

    === "Run doctest for a specific module"

        ```bash
        python -m doctest -v mppt/hello.py
        ```

    === "Run doctest for all the modules"

        ```bash
        python -m doctest -v mppt/*.py
        ```

    === "Run with pytest"

        ```bash
        pytest --doctest-modules
        ```

## Hypothesis

[Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a library for **property based testing**.

We can print the statistics of the hypothesis testing by adding the following command line option:

RUN: `pytest --hypothesis-show-statistics tests/test_sort.py`

??? "Testing statistics"

    ```python
    ======================== Hypothesis Statistics =========================
    tests/test_sort.py::TestQuickSort::test_integer:

      - during reuse phase (0.00 seconds):
        - Typical runtimes: < 1ms, of which < 1ms in data generation
        - 2 passing examples, 0 failing examples, 0 invalid examples

      - during generate phase (0.08 seconds):
        - Typical runtimes: < 1ms, of which < 1ms in data generation
        - 98 passing examples, 0 failing examples, 2 invalid examples

      - Stopped because settings.max_examples=100

      - during generate phase (0.40 seconds):
        - Typical runtimes: ~ 0-2 ms, of which ~ 0-2 ms in data generation

## Mutmut

[Mutmut](https://github.com/boxed/mutmut) is a mutation testing tool for Python.


## Locust

[Locust](https://locust.io/) is an easy-to-use, distributed, user load testing(stress testing) tool.

## Codecov

[Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/) is a code coverage tool.

Some configurations are needed to use Codecov to generate test coverage report.

!!! tip "Set the codecov token `CODECOV_TOKEN`"

    - Login your codecov account with GitHub: [https://about.codecov.io/](https://about.codecov.io/)
    - In codecov account, select the repository and you'll see a page named `Let's get your repo covered`. Just **COPY** the token here.
    - In the GitHub repository: `Setting` -> `Secrets and variables`: Add a `Repository secrets` named `CODECOV_TOKEN` and set the value with the token
