# Linter & Formatter & Code Quality Tools

Here we'll introduce the linter, formatter and code quality tools used in the project.
We won't introduce the tools in detail, but just give a brief introduction and some examples,
which are extracted from the official docs.


## Black, MyPy, Isort, Flake8(Recommended)
Now in used linters and formatters are `Black`, `MyPy`, `Isort`, `Flake8`, which are managed by `pre-commit` together.

## Black, MyPy and Ruff(Recommended)

After some reading[^1] and communication[^3], I think using `Black`, `MyPy` and `Ruff` maybe a better choice.
I'll try to explore Ruff later and try to use it in the project.

!!! note "Ruff is now in the template as extra linter and formatter"

    Later, we may use `Ruff` to replace `Isort` and `Flake8` in the project.


## Swiss Army Knife :-)

    ![](image/linters.png)

    There are a few of them out there. I really didn't understand what I was getting myself into.
    I had heard of some of them, but many of them have similar names and some I had never heard of,
    and I found the whole thing really confusing.[^1] - Al Sweigart


???+ note "The tools' categories"

    We use the categories defined by Al Sweigart in his blog[^2].


### [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) -> [pycodestyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle)

???+ quote "pep8 was **renamed** to pycodestyle"

    pycodestyle is a tool to check your Python code against some of the style conventions in PEP 8...
    This package used to be called pep8 but was **renamed** to pycodestyle to reduce confusion.
    - pycodestyle doc

- PEP 8 ‚Äì Style Guide for Python Code
- pycodestyle (formerly called pep8) - Python style guide checker

!!! note "We wouldn't use the pycodestyle package directly"

    We wouldn't use the pycodestyle package directly,
    but we would use the `flake8` package which is a wrapper around pycodestyle,
    and it also includes other tools like `pyflakes`(static analysis tool) and `mccabe`(complexity checker).


### [Isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort): Style Linter for Import Statements

???+ quote "isort your imports, so you don't have to."

    isort is a Python utility / library to **sort imports alphabetically**,
    and automatically separated into sections and by type.
    It provides a command line utility, Python library and plugins for various editors to quickly sort all your imports.
    It requires Python 3.7+ to run but supports formatting Python 2 code too.
    - isort doc

The example from isort doc is very clear:

Before isort:
```python
from my_lib import Object

import os

from my_lib import Object3

from my_lib import Object2

import sys

from third_party import lib15, lib1, lib2, lib3, lib4, lib5, lib6, lib7, lib8, lib9, lib10, lib11, lib12, lib13, lib14

import sys

from __future__ import absolute_import

from third_party import lib3

print("Hey")
print("yo")
```

After isort:
```python
from __future__ import absolute_import

import os
import sys

from third_party import (lib1, lib2, lib3, lib4, lib5, lib6, lib7, lib8,
                         lib9, lib10, lib11, lib12, lib13, lib14, lib15)

from my_lib import Object, Object2, Object3

print("Hey")
print("yo")

```

### [Flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8): Error & Style Linter, Complexity Analysis

For example, we have a file `hello.py`:

!!! example "hello.py"

    ```python
    print ( "Hello, World" )
    ```

After running `flake8 hello.py`, we got the following result:

```bash
hello.py:1:6: E211 whitespace before '('
hello.py:1:8: E201 whitespace after '('
hello.py:1:23: E202 whitespace before ')'
hello.py:1:25: W292 no newline at end of file
```

!!! warning "Break code style is easy in Python"

    We got four code style mistakes in a one line hello world code.

We can see that the flake8 only check the code style, but not fix it.
Later, we'll show how to use `black` to fix the code style automatically.


### [Black](https://github.com/psf/black): Code Formatter

!!! note "Black"

    Black is a PEP 8 compliant opinionated formatter with its own style.

Use black is simple, just run `black .` in the project root directory.
We can also use black on single file, just run `black hello.py`.

With the file `hello.py`:

!!! example "hello.py"

    ```python
    print ( "Hello, World" )
    ```

After running `black hello.py`, the code style is fixed:

```python
print("Hello, World")
```

Meantime, black also give us a statistics log:

```bash
reformatted hello.py

All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®
1 file reformatted, N files left unchanged.
```


### [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff): Linter & Formatter


As just mentioned before, many people recommend to use `Ruff`, because it's a very cool tool.

- It's **VERY** fast[^4]

</center>


### [Mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy): Type Checker
We use an example from official
[docs](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started.html#dynamic-vs-static-typing) of mypy.

!!! example "greeting"

    === "Without type hint"

        A function without type annotations is considered to be **dynamically typed** by mypy:

        ```python
        def greeting(name):
            return 'Hello ' + name

        greeting(123)
        greeting(b"Alice")
        ```
        By default, mypy will not type check dynamically typed functions.
        This means that with a few exceptions, mypy will not report any errors with regular unannotated Python.

    === "With type hint"

        ```python
        def greeting(name: str) -> str:
            return 'Hello ' + name

        greeting(3)
        ```
        This function is now **statically typed**:
        mypy will use the provided type hints to detect incorrect use of the greeting function and
        incorrect use of variables within the greeting function.

        After run `mypy hello.py`, we got the following result:

        ```bash
        hello.py:5: error: Argument 1 to "greeting" has incompatible type "int"; expected "str"  [arg-type]
        Found 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)
        ```


### [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
Pre-commit can be treated as a linter manager, it can manage the linters in the project and run them in a batch.


!!! example "Pre-commit run result"

    === "Config"

        ```yaml
        repos:
          - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
            rev: v4.5.0
            hooks:
              - id: check-toml
              - id: check-yaml
              - id: end-of-file-fixer
              - id: trailing-whitespace
                exclude: .+\.csv
              - id: mixed-line-ending
                args: [--fix=lf]
          - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
            rev: 23.11.0
            hooks:
              - id: black
          - repo: https://github.com/pycqa/isort
            rev: 5.12.0
            hooks:
              - id: isort
                args: ["--profile", "black"]
          - repo: https://github.com/pycqa/flake8
            rev: 6.1.0
            hooks:
              - id: flake8
          - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy
            rev: v1.7.1  # Use the sha / tag you want to point at
            hooks:
              - id: mypy
                args: [--strict, --ignore-missing-imports]
        ```

    === "Run result"

        ```bash
        check toml...............................................................Passed
        check yaml...............................................................Passed
        fix end of files.........................................................Passed
        trim trailing whitespace.................................................Passed
        mixed line ending........................................................Passed
        black....................................................................Passed
        isort....................................................................Passed
        flake8...................................................................Passed
        mypy.....................................................................Passed
        ```




???+ tip "Pre-commit quick start (with Poetry)"

    - Fellow the `Quick start` in [https://pre-commit.com/](https://pre-commit.com/#quick-start)
    - Run `poetry add pre-commit` to install `pre-commit` into the project
    - Run `pre-commit install` to install the hooks
    - Run `poetry shell` into the created python venv environment
    - Run `pre-commit run -a` to check all the files in the project
