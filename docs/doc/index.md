# Documentation

## Mkdocs(Recommended)

!!! note "Mkdocs"

    [Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator
    that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown,
    and configured with a single YAML configuration file.

### Deploy the docs in GitHub Pages

Some configuration is needed to deploy the documentation site to GitHub Pages.

!!! tip "Give the GitHub Action permission to deploy the docs"

    - In the repository: `Setting` -> `Actions` -> `Workflow permissions`: Select `Read and write permissions`



## Why Mkdocs?

### Markdown is better than reStructuredText

Compare to reStructuredText, Markdown is more popular and easier to use.

### Material theme is Awesome

[Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
is a theme for Mkdocs, it is a modern theme with a focus on **usability** and **customizability**.

!!! note "Material theme: Documentation that simply works"

    Write your documentation in Markdown and create a professional static site in minutes – searchable, customizable,
    in 60+ languages, for all devices.


## Alternatives

### Sphinx

Some old projects still use [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) to generate documentation.
But reStructuredText is still not easy to use compare to Markdown.
